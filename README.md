This project aims to provide an intelligent and interactive platform that allows users to virtually design and furnish an empty room using AI-powered recommendations. The system analyzes the room layout and aesthetics to suggest suitable furniture such as sofas, chairs, and beds. Users can drag and drop 3D models of these furniture items directly into the image of the room, enabling a realistic and customizable interior design experience.

The core AI component ensures that the recommended furniture matches the style, dimensions, and color tone of the room. This enhances the overall usability and helps users make informed choices in real-time. The drag-and-drop functionality gives users complete freedom to arrange and visualize the furniture layout as they wish.

Key Features:

AI-driven furniture recommendation based on room image analysis

Drag-and-drop interface for 3D models of sofa, chair, bed, etc.
